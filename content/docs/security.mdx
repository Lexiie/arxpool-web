description: Guardrails that keep ArxPool aligned with production-ready expectations.
order: 4

| Rule | Description |
| --- | --- |
| No plaintext | SDK never decrypts user data; ciphertext stays opaque end to end. |
| Secrets in env | `ARXPOOL_ATTESTER_SECRET` and `ARCIUM_API_KEY` live in environment variables only. |
| Deterministic signatures | Uses Ed25519 plus canonical JSON before signing so results are reproducible. |
| Pure verification | `verifyResult()` runs offline with no network fetches required. |
| Redacted logs | Console output replaces payloads with `[ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD]` markers. |
| HTTPS only | All communications flow through TLS (e.g., Vercel-managed SSL). |

Security is a first-class citizen in ArxPool's architecture.
