| Rule | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| No plaintext persistence | Ciphertext is redacted to `[ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD]` before it touches the in-memory store. |
| Secrets live in env | `ARXPOOL_ATTESTER_SECRET` and `ARXPOOL_ATTESTER_KEY` never ship to the client bundle. |
| Deterministic signatures | Stub mode simulates Ed25519 verification so `verifyResult()` can run offline. |
| Redacted logs | Server handlers never log request bodies that might contain ciphertext. |
| HTTPS only | Deploy on Vercel (or similar) so TLS is mandatory end to end. |

These guardrails let you prototype safely while matching the constraints of the live collector.
