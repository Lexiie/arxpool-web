## 1. No plaintext logging

Console statements scrub payloads. Visibility comes from metadata, not sensitive input.

## 2. Ephemeral storage

`lib/db.ts` stores pools in-process only. Restarting the server wipes state, mimicking the stateless collector contract.

## 3. Deterministic verification

`verifyResult()` is pure and uses only the payload returned by the API. This makes it portable for CI or client testing.

## 4. Strict typing

TypeScript runs in `strict` mode, forcing you to handle edge cases explicitly.

## 5. HTTPS + Vercel

Deployments inherit Vercel certificates, so browsers negotiate TLS automatically.
