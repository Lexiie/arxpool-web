description: Understand the core concepts behind encrypted pools and how the demo portal works.

ArxPool powers secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) workflows where participants submit ciphertext and compute results without revealing plaintext inputs.

## Conceptual flow

1. A **pool** is created with attestation metadata and optional policy.
2. Participants **join** by encrypting payloads with the SDK and submitting ciphertext to the collector API.
3. The backend calls `computePool()` to aggregate encrypted inputs.
4. Clients fetch `/api/result` and run `verifyResult()` to validate signatures.

## Why this portal matters

- **Landing** explains the value proposition for decision makers and builders.
- **Docs** live in MDX so they stay close to the codebase.
- **Demo** provides an interactive playground wired to the stub collector.
- **Collector** API routes mirror production shapes, making migrations seamless.

Keep this repo handy as your reference implementation before moving to a real Arcium attester.
