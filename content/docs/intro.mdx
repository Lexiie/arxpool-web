description: Understand how ArxPool bridges encrypted coordination with the Arcium ecosystem.
order: 1

ArxPool is the encrypted pooling toolkit for builders on top of **Arcium's multiparty computation network**. It bundles the landing page, MDX docs, interactive demo, and collector API into a single Next.js portal so teams can:

- Collect encrypted inputs without ever touching plaintext.
- Trigger attested compute jobs that mirror the production collector contract.
- Verify signed results directly in the browser before acting on them.

### Ecosystem fit

ArxPool lives inside the broader Arcium stack:

- **Arcium MXE** executes the secure computation.
- **ArxPool SDK** exposes configure → create → join → compute → verify helpers.
- **Collector API** runs server-side to store redacted ciphertext and request compute.

Use this portal to experiment in stub mode, then swap to the Arcium testnet once your node URL and attester keys are ready.
