ArxPool is a privacy-focused SDK built on top of Arcium's encrypted compute layer (MXE). It provides a composable way to collect, aggregate, and verify encrypted data so teams can experiment with secure coordination without exposing user inputs.

## Key features

- **End-to-end encryption** -- ciphertext never leaves the secure path, so plaintext leakage is impossible.
- **Verifiable compute** -- Arcium MXE issues attestations that the SDK can verify client-side.
- **Stub + live parity** -- run in offline stub mode today and switch to Arcium testnet once keys are ready.
- **Developer-first APIs** -- modern TypeScript surface area with helpers for pools, joins, compute, and verification.

Keep this page handy as the mental model for how landing, docs, demo, and collector fit together inside ArxPool.
