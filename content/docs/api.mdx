## POST /api/pool/create

Creates a pool with a generated ID and attester metadata.

Request body:

```json
{
  "name": "Governance Test",
  "policy": {
    "maxParticipants": 64
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "poolId": "pool_123",
  "attestation": {
    "issuer": "arxpool-local",
    "timestamp": 1710000000
  }
}
```

## POST /api/join

Accepts SDK-encrypted payloads.

- Validates `poolId` existence.
- Persists ciphertext in memory only.
- Never logs plaintext or ciphertext.

## POST /api/pool/compute

Calls `computePool()` from `lib/sdk.ts`. When `USE_STUB=true`, deterministic results are returned so the UI can show an end-to-end success message.

## GET /api/result?poolId=pool_123

Returns the latest signed result plus metadata. Clients should still run `verifyResult()` from the SDK to be sure.
