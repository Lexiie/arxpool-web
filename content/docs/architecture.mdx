description: Trace the encrypted data path from clients to Arcium and back.

```
User → ArxPool SDK → Collector API → Arcium Node → verifyResult()
```

1. **User** encrypts a choice client-side.
2. **SDK** normalises payloads and signs requests.
3. **Collector API** stores ciphertext in memory and calls `computePool()`.
4. **Arcium Node** (stub or testnet) returns an attested result.
5. **verifyResult()** runs in the browser to confirm the signature and job commit.

The portal keeps this flow fully contained so you can swap environments without rewriting plumbing.
