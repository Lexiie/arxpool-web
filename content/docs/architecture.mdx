```
User → ArxPool SDK (frontend)
     → Collector API (backend)
     → Arcium MXE (compute layer)
     → Job Receipt / Attestation
     → verifyResult() (client)
```

## Components

- **Client SDK** -- handles encryption, submission, and verification helpers.
- **Collector API** -- receives ciphertext, triggers computation, and exposes signed receipts.
- **Arcium MXE** -- executes secure multiparty computation once the project goes live.
- **Verifier** -- validates attestations plus `job_commit` hashes before acting on results.

## Why it matters

ArxPool abstracts complex encrypted compute into simple functions. Builders can remix the toolkit for private voting, analytics, AI collaborations, or DeFi protocols that require confidential aggregation -- all without reimplementing the cryptography stack.
